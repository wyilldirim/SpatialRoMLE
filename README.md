# SpatialRoMLE

**Robust Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Spatial Error Model in R**

SpatialRoMLE is an R package developed for robust estimation of the Spatial Error Model using maximum likelihood techniques. It is designed to be resistant to spatial outliers and contamination in the data, providing more reliable inference compared to classical methods.

## 📦 Features

- Robust estimation via M-estimators
- Handles spatial autocorrelation in the error term
- Support for various robust ψ-functions
- Compatible with `spdep` and spatial weights
- Useful for spatial econometrics and environmental statistics
